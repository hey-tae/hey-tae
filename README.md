I am a Software Engineer based in Boston passionate about meeting user experience needs as well as for creating intuitive solutions for users, both in terms of software & design. With my previous experience in customer experience and formal training in Visual Media Arts, I love to bring my creative skills to problem-solving when it comes to building software. I'm passionate about making tech more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. 

When Iâ€™m not learning about the jiggy world of Javascript. You can find me at any local taqueria, trying to convince my daughter to start a band with me, or learning a new social media dance.
